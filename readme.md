# JavaScript Coding Exercises

## 1. Array Filtering and Mapping

Create an array of objects, each representing a person with properties like `name`, `age`, and `gender`. Write a function to filter out all females and then map the remaining people to an array of names. Print the final result.

## 2. Object Manipulation

Create an array of objects representing books with properties like `title`, `author`, and `year`. Write a function that takes the array and returns a new array with only the book titles. Print the result.

## 3. Function Composition

Write three functions: one to square a number, one to double a number, and one to add 5 to a number. Compose these functions to create a new function that squares a number, doubles the result, and then adds 5.

## 4. Sorting Objects

Create an array of objects representing cars with properties like `make`, `model`, and `year`. Write a function to sort the array of cars by the year of manufacture in ascending order. Print the sorted array.

## 5. Find and Modify

Write a function that searches an array of objects for a specific person by name. If found, modify their age property. Print the updated array.

## 6. Array Reduction

Create an array of numbers. Write a function that uses the `reduce` method to calculate the sum of all even numbers in the array.

## 7. Leap Year Checker

Write a function that determines whether a given year is a leap year.

## 8. Unique Values

Create an array of numbers with some duplicate values. Write a function to filter out the duplicate values and return a new array with only unique numbers. Print the result.

## 9. Find Maximum Value

Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the maximum value.

## 10. Advanced Sorting

Create an array of objects representing students with `name` and `grades` properties. Write a function to sort the students by average grade in descending order.

## 11. Functional Programming - Reduce

Write a function that uses the `reduce` function to calculate the total value of an array of objects with `quantity` and `price` properties.
